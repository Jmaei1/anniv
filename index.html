                    <p>A whole year 365 days of love, laughter, and yes, our fair share of misunderstandings too. Who would have thought that meeting in such an unexpected way would lead to something this deep, this real? I never imagined that someone miles away could make such a big impact on my heart, but here we are, proving that distance means nothing when love is real.</p>
                    <p>LDR isn‚Äôt easy there are moments when it truly tests my patience (and you know that all too well ü§°), but through every challenge, every late-night call, and every little moment in between, I still choose you. Every. Single. Day. Because it‚Äôs you, Aman.</p>
                    <p>I just need to know that we‚Äôre truly in this together, that it‚Äôs not just words but actions too. And deep down, I believe in us. I believe in the love we‚Äôve built, the memories we‚Äôve made, and the future we‚Äôre slowly creating. I love you soooo much, and I never want to doubt what we have. So let‚Äôs keep proving that this love is worth every second, every challenge, every mile between us.</p>
                    <p>One year down, forever to go. ü©∑‚ú®</p>

Every day with you is so special, and I just want you to know how much I appreciate you. You really are the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me, and I feel so lucky to have you in my life. ü•∞</p>
                    <p>I know I‚Äôm not always the easiest person to deal with, especially with how much I miss you and how much I worry about everything. But you‚Äôve been so patient with me, so loving, and so understanding. For that, I am endlessly thankful.</p>

                    <p><br>
                        Amankot, you are like a tree,<br>
                        
                        Grown strong, yet still, you lean to me,<br>
                        
                        From roots that stretch through time and space,<br>
                        
                        You bloom in my heart, a steady grace.<br>
                        
                        Your branches reach out, though far you stand,<br>
                        
                        Yet I can feel your gentle hand,<br>
                        
                        A touch that nurtures, calm and kind,<br>
                        
                        Even when the world‚Äôs unkind.<br>
                        
                        You are the sapling in my dreams,<br>
                        
                        Planted where the sunlight gleams,<br>
                        
                        And though we‚Äôre miles apart, you grow,<br>
                        
                        Through every word, through every glow.<br>
                        
                        Like leaves that rustle in the breeze,<br>
                        
                        Your love whispers through the trees,<br>
                        
                        A tender murmur, soft and pure,<br>
                        
                        That reassures my heart is sure.<br>
                        
                        The storms may come, the winds may howl,<br>
                        
                        But like a tree, you don‚Äôt just bow <br>
                        
                        You stand, you sway, you bend but hold,<br>
                        
                        A steadfast strength in shades of gold.<br>
                        
                        Your roots, though buried deep in earth,<br>
                        
                        Stretch to me, and bring me mirth,<br>
                        
                        For in each whispered, quiet prayer,<br>
                        
                        I know you're waiting, always there.<br>
                        
                        The seasons change, the world may spin,<br>
                        
                        But in my heart, you‚Äôll always win,<br>
                        
                        For every leaf that falls away,<br>
                        
                        Another blooms to light our way.<br>
                        
                        And when the winter winds may freeze,<br>
                        
                        I‚Äôll carry you within the trees,<br>
                        
                        Your warmth will always find its way,<br>
                        
                        To thaw my heart on coldest days.<br>
                        
                        Amankot, my love, though skies divide,<br>
                        
                        You‚Äôre like the plant that cannot hide<br>
                        
                        Your beauty shines through every hour,<br>
                        
                        A steady, constant, blooming flower.<br>
                        
                        The distance fades, the years may pass,<br>
                        
                        But like a tree, we‚Äôll always last,<br>
                        
                        For love, like roots, will deeply grow,<br>
                        
                        In every storm, through every glow.<br>
                        </p>
                    <p>There‚Äôs no distance too great to separate two hearts that are meant to be together. No matter the miles between us, I know I‚Äôm still right there with you. Every thought, every prayer, every heartbeat, it all belongs to us, to the love we share.</p><br>
                    <p>You‚Äôve become such an important part of my life, and there‚Äôs no going back. We‚Äôve come so far already, and I know we‚Äôll keep growing together. The time we‚Äôve spent apart only makes our bond stronger.</p>
